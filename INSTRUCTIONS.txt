How to Run the Brown Bear Visualization

This project uses local data files (.json and .geojson).
For security reasons, modern browsers do not allow these files to load correctly if you open index.html by double-clicking it.

To view the visualization properly, please run a small local server.
There are two simple options:

Option 1 (Recommended): Use VS Code Live Server

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code

Install the extension “Live Server” (if not installed)

Right-click the file index.html

Choose “Open with Live Server”

The visualization will open automatically in your browser.

Option 2: Use Python’s Built-In Web Server

If you prefer running from the terminal:

Open a terminal / command prompt

Navigate to the project folder:

cd path/to/the/project


Start a local server:

python -m http.server


Open the following address in your browser:

http://localhost:8000

That’s it!

The visualization should now load correctly, including:

interactive map

bear movement data

municipality boundaries

monthly time slider

hover highlights

bear path toggle
